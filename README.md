Android VM/iOS Simulator are just appetize.io demo webclips but embed for fullscreen (currently simulating Pixel 7 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max)

PrismarineJS is a ivi.cx generated webclip that goes to mcraft.fun to allow playing minecraft (web client is buggy etc but its basically the only good one out there for mobile etc)

(btw ivi.cx is pretty old now i think as it sometimes doesnt generate working web clips occasionally the other webclips that werent made with ivi.cx were made with apple configurator)

Android VM/iOS Simulator are just appetize.io demo webclips but embed for fullscreen (currently simulating Pixel 7 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max)
PrismarineJS is a ivi.cx generated webclip that goes to mcraft.fun to allow playing minecraft (web client is buggy etc but its basically the only good one out there for mobile etc)
